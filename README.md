# Pulse-width modulation (PWM) generation using a 555 timer

## Components used:

### 2 NP10U50V capacitors, the first with a value of 10nF connected to pin 5 of the 555, the other with a value of 1nF connected via a 1N4148 diode to pin 7 of the timer.
### 1k resistor whose terminals are connected to power and the other to a 3009P-1-104LF potentiometer. The waveform is reflected on the oscilloscope.
